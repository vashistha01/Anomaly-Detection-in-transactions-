Financial Transaction Anomaly Detection System

The Financial Transaction Anomaly Detection System aims to identify unusual or fraudulent transactions within a dataset.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, this system helps detect anomalies that deviate from typical transaction patterns.
Anomaly detection involves identifying outliers in a dataset primarily composed of ‘normal’ data points.
In the context of financial transactions, anomalies can represent fraudulent activity or errors.
Detecting such anomalies is crucial for maintaining the integrity of financial systems.
